        <h1>Multisite</h1>
        <p>This project is using a WordPress Multisite to provide networks and communities a way to communicate through a website with ease and share information across networks. The primary public repository for this project is hosted on Gitorious (https://gitorious.org/glocal/activist-network).</p>

<a name="activist-network" class="anchor" href="#activist-network"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Activist Network</h1>

<p>The Activist network is a pre-configured WordPress Multisite that allows activists &amp; organizers to create a space where groups and projects can have their own website within a network and the news, events &amp; user profiles are shared across the network and highlighted on the main site.</p>

<p>The flow chart below provides an idea of what a network would look like with one main site displaying the data and being the face of the network for each sub site to communicate and share with their communities</p>

<h2>
<a name="functionality" class="anchor" href="#functionality"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Functionality</h2>

<p>This section refers to the back-end/admin features needed to organize the content within the templates. We will build around WordPress core.</p>

<h3>
<a name="news" class="anchor" href="#news"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>News</h3>

<p>News is the posts (or blog) section of the site. Content here can be formatted around taxonomies &amp; post formats.</p>

<h3>
<a name="taxonomy" class="anchor" href="#taxonomy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Taxonomy</h3>

<p>The default taxonomies in WordPress are the Categories &amp; Tags. This can be used as default and through provide training &amp; documentation on best practices for usage.</p>

<h3>
<a name="post-formats" class="anchor" href="#post-formats"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Post Formats</h3>

<p>Post Formats, refer to the type of content which is connected to templates in the theme. The formats available in WordPress for use are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>aside</strong>  - Typically styled without a title. Similar to a Facebook note update.</li>
<li>
<strong>gallery</strong>  - A gallery of images. Post will likely contain a gallery shortcode and will have image attachments.</li>
<li>
<strong>link</strong>  - A link to another site. Themes may wish to use the first href tag in the post content as the external link for that post. An alternative approach could be if the post consists only of a URL, then that will be the URL and the title (post_title) will be the name attached to the anchor for it.</li>
<li>
<strong>image</strong>  - A single image. The first image tag in the post could be considered the image. Alternatively, if the post consists only of a URL, that will be the image URL and the title of the post (post_title) will be the title attribute for the image.</li>
<li>
<strong>quote</strong>  - A quotation. Probably will contain a blockquote holding the quote content. Alternatively, the quote may be just the content, with the source/author being the title.</li>
<li>
<strong>video</strong>  - A single video. The first  tag or object/embed in the post content could be considered the video. Alternatively, if the post consists only of a URL, that will be the video URL. May also contain the video as an attachment to the post, if video support is enabled on the blog (like via a plugin).</li>
<li>
<strong>audio</strong>  - An audio file. Could be used for Podcasting.</li>
<li>
<del><strong>chat</strong>  - A chat transcript, like so:</del> </li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="social-integration" class="anchor" href="#social-integration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Social Integration</h3>

<p>Explore using Keyring to accomplish this around post formats. This actually archives data on the site as opposed to the only leaving on commercial/proprietary network.</p>

<ul>
<li>[[<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring/%7Chttp://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring/%5D">http://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring/|http://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring/]</a>]</li>

</ul><h2>
<a name="events" class="anchor" href="#events"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Events</h2>

<p>This is a custom post type created using the [[<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/%7CEvents">http://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager/|Events</a> Manager]] plugin that allows for a creation of global (or shared) events table to display events from all sub-sites on the main site. There is a wide variety of options available through the admin area of the site for customizations on a site by site basis and there are some network wide settings that allows for easier management.</p>

<h2>
<a name="user-profiles" class="anchor" href="#user-profiles"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>User Profiles</h2>

<p>Individuals will be able to register as users to the network to get notifications and add content based on what the site admins decide. For this front-end profile pages will be provided for users to add their bio and social links to appear below each post or event they post and create a custom author or user template. For this we will use:</p>

<ul>
<li> [[<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-biographia/%7Chttp://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-biographia/%5D">http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-biographia/|http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-biographia/]</a>]

<ul>
<li>There are a lot of settings to allow site admins ways to control where this information appears. The rest is controlled within templates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> [[<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/%7Chttp://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/%5D">http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/|http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/]</a>]

<ul>
<li>Provider frontend login, logout, reset password pages and a widget that allows to show links based on user role.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="if%20already%20a%20user%20on%20one%20site,%20if%20a%20user%20tries%20to%20register%20again%20it%20won't%20work,%20this%20will%20allow%20them%20to%20register%20to%20multiple%20sites%20with%20the%20same%20username.">[http://wordpress.org/plugins/join-my-multisite/|http://wordpress.org/plugins/join-my-multisite/]</a></li>
